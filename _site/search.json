    "text": "The pharmaverse has quickly established itself as a community standard for open-source clinical reporting, with packages like sdtm.oak for SDTM transformation, admiral for ADaM derivations and gtsummary for TFL generation. Emerging in the background is the new analysis results dataset standard, ARS, which cards can be used to support and shiny/web based tools to review visualizations as alternative to static reports. In parallel, the gsm framework, in particular the gsm.core package, has matured as a YAML-driven workflow engine providing reproducibility, traceability, and audit-ready pipelines for data science in clinical development. These ecosystems have typically evolved in parallel, but their complementary strengths create an opportunity for integration.\n\n\n\nWe present a hybrid “gsm–pharmaverse” pipeline demonstrating how gsm.core can orchestrate pharmaverse packages end-to-end, transforming raw eCRF data into SDTM, ADaM, TFL outputs and even the emerging ARS. This case study highlights how harmonizing these ecosystems can accelerate adoption of open-source R workflows in regulated clinical trial reporting.\n\n\n\n\nRaw → SDTM (gsm + sdtm.oak): Raw data were transformed into SDTM using gsm workflows, following a pre-existing sdtm.oak example for the VS domain as a reference implementation. An example can be found here.\nSDTM → ADaM (gsm + admiral): SDTM domains were re-integrated into gsm workflows and passed through admiral derivations. Functions such as derive_vars_merged() and derive_param_map() were used to generate ADVS parameters and analysis values (e.g., MAP). Derivation logic was defined declaratively via YAML !expr tags, ensuring transformations were reproducible, transparent, and auditable.\nADaM → TFLs (gsm + gtsummary): From the derived ADaM datasets, gsm workflows directly invoked gtsummary to generate table outputs. This enabled the production of publication-ready TFLs within a fully traceable, end-to-end pipeline.\nADaM → ARS (gsm + cards; exploratory): In parallel, the same ADaM datasets were extended using cards to explore the generation of ARS-aligned datasets and outputs. As ARS standards continue to evolve, this demonstrates how emerging libraries can be incorporated into the gsm framework with minimal friction.\nSDTM/ADaM → Shiny (gsm + safetyCharts; exploratory): Given the growing adoption of web-based visualization across organizations, gsm workflows were also evaluated as a mechanism to automatically refresh Shiny applications with newly derived data, supporting near-real-time exploratory and safety review.\n\n\n\n\nThe pipeline successfully demonstrated that gsm.core can orchestrate a start to finish pharmaverse toolchain: sdtm.oak standardized raw data into SDTM, admiral derived ADaM datasets, gtsummary produced clinical tables, and cards structured ARS datasets.\nEach package retained its modular design, while gsm.core ensured workflow control, auditability, and reproducibility across the pipeline.\n\n\n\nThis hybrid gsm–pharmaverse case study illustrates the feasibility of an open-source end-to-end clinical reporting pipeline. gsm.core serves as the workflow backbone, while pharmaverse packages provide domain-specific transformations for SDTM, ADaM, TFLs, and ARS. Together, they deliver a modular and transparent solution for clinical trial reporting, that is ready for automation. We propose this as a model for future collaboration between workflow frameworks and pharmaverse packages, moving the industry toward interoperable open-source standards."
