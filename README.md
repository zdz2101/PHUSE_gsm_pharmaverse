# PHUSE_gsm_pharmaverse

The `pharmaverse` has quickly established itself as a community standard for open-source clinical reporting,
with packages like `sdtm.oak` for SDTM transformation,
`admiral` for ADaM derivations, 
`cards` for Analysis Results Standards (ARS) datasets,
and `gtsummary` for TFL generation.
In parallel, the `gsm` framework, in particular the `gsm.core`, has matured as a YAML-driven workflow engine providing
reproducibility, traceability, and audit-ready pipelines for data science in clinical development.
These ecosystems have typically evolved in parallel, but their complementary strengths create an opportunity for integration.
