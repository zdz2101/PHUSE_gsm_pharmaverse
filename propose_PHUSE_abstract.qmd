# FOR ABSTRACT (~150 words)

Open-source tools for clinical trial reporting have matured within the pharmaverse, offering modular solutions for transforming data into recognized industry standards. In parallel, the gsm suite of packages provides a flexible, customizable framework for building data pipelines through YAML-driven workflows. We present a gsm–pharmaverse pipeline that integrates key packages—sdtm.oak for SDTM, admiral for ADaM, cards for ARS, and gtsummary for TFLs—into a connected system of workflows, each supporting its respective stage. With YAML control files serving as human-readable checklists, the gsm framework ensures the right tool is applied at the right stage, guiding data seamlessly from raw capture through analysis datasets to final tables. 

{gsm} workflows are built to be highly flexible and customizable. They provide standard support for both public and private R packages, and study customization is easy to implement and track using standard version control best practices. Further, gsm workflows are designed to be highly modular. They can be maintained either by individual contributors (e.g. Biostatisticians running R scripts monthly) or deployed as part of automated pipelines (e.g. via scheduled GitHub actions, or as components of fully validated Statistical Compute Environments). This approach streamlines reporting, reduces manual effort, and ensures every step is both documented and repeatable, strengthening quality oversight and regulatory compliance.

# Harmonizing gsm and the Pharmaverse: Orchestrating SDTM, ADaM, TFLs, and ARS in a Unified R Workflow

## Background:

The `pharmaverse` has quickly established itself as a community standard for open-source clinical reporting, with packages like `sdtm.oak` for SDTM transformation, `admiral` for ADaM derivations, `cards` for Analysis Results Standards (ARS) datasets, and `gtsummary` for TFL generation. In parallel, the `gsm` framework, in particular the `gsm.core` package, has matured as a YAML-driven workflow engine providing reproducibility, traceability, and audit-ready pipelines for data science in clinical development. These ecosystems have typically evolved in parallel, but their complementary strengths create an opportunity for integration.

## Objective:

We present a hybrid "gsm–pharmaverse" pipeline demonstrating how `gsm.core` can orchestrate `pharmaverse` packages end-to-end, transforming raw eCRF data into SDTM, ADaM, TFL outputs and even the emerging ARS. This case study highlights how harmonizing these ecosystems can accelerate adoption of open-source R workflows in regulated clinical trial reporting.

## Methods:

-   **Raw → SDTM (gsm + sdtm.oak):** CDASH-style parquet files for Demographics (DM) and Vital Signs (VS) were mapped into SDTM domains using `gsm.core` workflows calling `sdtm.oak` ensuring CDISC-conformant transformations.

-   **SDTM → ADaM (gsm + admiral):** SDTM domains were re-plugged into gsm workflows, where complex functions such as `admiral::derive_vars_merged()` derived ADSL variables like baseline weight and BMI. Using YAML `!expr` tags, the derivation logic was specified declaratively, keeping transformations reproducible and auditable.

-   **ADaM → TFLs (gsm + gtsummary):** From the derived ADaM, gsm workflows directly called `gtsummary` to render Table 1 demographic summaries. This produced publication-ready TFLs in a fully traceable pipeline.

-   **ADaM → ARS (gsm + cards, exploratory):** In parallel, the same ADaM datasets were extended using **cards** to begin shaping ARS-compliant datasets/outputs. As the landscape for ARS develops, the potential for integration of appropriate libraries like `cards` fits into the gsm framework easily as well.

## Results:

The pipeline successfully demonstrated that `gsm.core` can orchestrate a start to finish pharmaverse toolchain: sdtm.oak standardized raw data into SDTM, admiral derived ADaM datasets, gtsummary produced clinical tables, and cards structured ARS datasets.

Each package retained its modular design, while `gsm.core` ensured workflow control, auditability, and reproducibility across the pipeline.

## Conclusions:

This hybrid `gsm–pharmaverse` case study illustrates the feasibility of an open-source end-to-end clinical reporting pipeline. `gsm.core` serves as the workflow backbone, while pharmaverse packages provide domain-specific transformations for SDTM, ADaM, TFLs, and ARS. Together, they deliver a modular and transparent solution for clinical trial reporting, that is ready for automation. We propose this as a model for future collaboration between workflow frameworks and pharmaverse packages, moving the industry toward interoperable open-source standards.
